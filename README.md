# Unified ORF Assessment Code (ICASSP 2024 + 2025)

This repository provides code accompanying our two-part work on automatic **children’s Oral Reading Fluency (ORF)** assessment.

- **ICASSP 2025 (Full / unified repo):** *A Unified Model for Oral Reading Fluency and Student Prosody*   

## What this repo contains

- Implementation of the **Part 1** method (ICASSP 2024), including the core sub-sequence matching logic operating over learned acoustic representations. 
- Additional code introduced in **Part 2** (ICASSP 2025) to form a more unified modeling approach spanning ORF and student prosody.
